    "persons $i$ and $j$ from the network meet physically. The problem is\n",
    "to determine the minimal effort required to block the physical contact\n",
    "between persons in the network such that the infection does not reach\n",

    "An alternative way is by the median, ie, the measurement that is worse\n",
    "than half of the other scores and better than the other half.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a close connection between these statistics and\n",
    "optimization. It is easy to show that the mean is the measure that\n",
    "minimizes the sum of squared deviation between the data points and\n",
    "itself and that the median minimizes the sum of the absolute values of\n",
    "the differences between each data point and itself. (How?)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider now a set of points on a two-dimensional space\n",
    "$S=(x_1,y_1),\\ldots,(x_m,y_m)$. The points are measurements of a response\n",
    "variable given some control variable, for example, blood pressure given\n",
    "the weight of a person. The points hint at a linear dependency between\n",
    "the variables representing the two dimensions. We may assume a random\n",
    "fluctuation around the right value and hence the following regression\n",

    "We thus want to find a line that best fits the measured points. That is,\n",
    "we wish to determine the (unknown) numbers $a$ and $b$. There is no\n",
    "unique criterion to formulate the desire that a given line ``best fits''\n",
    "the points. The task can be achieved by minimizing, in some sense, the\n",

    "minimizing either the sum of the squares of the $\\epsilon_i$'s or the\n",

    "more robust estimate of a collection of numbers than the means, the\n",
